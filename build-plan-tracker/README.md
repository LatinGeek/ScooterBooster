## Last Session

- Date: 2026-04-22
- Completed: Phase 18 got another useful dev-side hardening pass. API responses now carry `x-request-id`, pino logs include the same request ID for request-based handlers, and the admin observability panel now reflects structured logging readiness alongside health, Sentry, analytics, and reminder prerequisites. Verification stayed green with targeted observability tests, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.
- Next: Keep closing the remaining partial dev-addressable phases — especially any final SEO/legal and testing polish before we intentionally shift back toward Phase 21 deployment work.
