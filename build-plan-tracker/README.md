## Last Session

- Date: 2026-04-19
- Completed: Dev-mode QA is now in a much healthier place - unit tests (`125`), Playwright E2E (`13`), lint, and build are all green locally; loopback auth/session handling is stable in production-mode Playwright; Phase 16 tracker drift was corrected with the cookie page/banner + JSON-LD work; and the Firestore seed catalog now includes the asset-backed Xiaomi, Atom, Joyor, MiStyle, and Navee models from `public/assets/scooter-model-images`.
- Next: Keep iterating in dev mode on the remaining non-prod gaps - desktop/authenticated manual QA polish, technician application UX coverage, and any remaining admin/notification/catalog completeness items before we revisit Phase 21 production work.
