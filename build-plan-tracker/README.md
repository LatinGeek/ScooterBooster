## Last Session

- Date: 2026-04-20
- Completed: Dev mode is still fully green - `npm test` (`133`), `npm run test:e2e` (`15`), `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` all pass locally. Phase 14 now has real product surface area: users have an in-app notification bell with unread badge, a `/dashboard/notifications` center, Firestore-backed notification documents, and booking lifecycle triggers for pending-payment / confirmation / in-progress / completion / technician cancellation updates.
- Next: Keep closing partial build-plan items that do not depend on prod access - WhatsApp deep-link cleanup, reminder automation/email depth, admin CRUD/audit visibility, and broader manual QA before we touch Phase 21 again.
