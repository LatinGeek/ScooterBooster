## Last Session

- Date: 2026-04-25
- Completed: Phase 18 is now complete. Sentry source maps were already verified in preview, and Axiom ingestion is now confirmed for dataset scooterbooster, closing the last log-drain/platform-side observability gap.
- Next: Focus on the remaining blocked external integration in Phase 17: a true hosted MercadoPago payment confirmation loop back into the app.
